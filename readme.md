# Sitecore Configuration Roles

This document describes how to configure a Sitecore instance to use one of the pre-defined server roles. After you install a Sitecore instance, the only changes you need to make are to install the module and update settings that define which server role it will have.

## Available in Sitecore 9.0 out-of-box

This project has become deprecated since **Sitecore 9.0.0** release, which offers same functionality with extra benefits such as:

* refactored configuration files (stock `App_Config/Include/**` contents was moved to `App_Config/Sitecore`)
* pre-configured roles (`App_Config/Sitecore.config` is annotated as well as `/App_Config/Sitecore/**`)
* search engine support (`Lucene`, `Solr`, `Azure`)
* custom prefixes (you can add as many `something:define="option1"` and `something:require="option2"` as you want)
* layers of configuration via `App_Config/Layers.config` (added `App_Config/Environment` and `App_Config/Modules`)

## Prerequsites

In this project Sitecore configuration engine was extended with two simple commands
and modified configuration files that use them. It is distributed as a module which
is based on the `Sitecore CMS 8.1 rev. 160302 (Update-2)` which now allows patching 
configuration engine.

## How to

### 1. Install NuGet Package

Install the `Sitecore.Configuration.Roles` NuGet package:
```ps
PS> Install-Package Sitecore.Configuration.Roles
```
Alternatively, you can [download it here](https://github.com/Sitecore/Sitecore-Configuration-Roles/releases) and unpack to the `bin` folder.

### 2. Replace Include Configuration Files

Replace default Sitecore configuration files in `App_Config/Include` folder with annotated ones. 

Delete entire contents of `App_Config/Include` folder (**except `DataFolder.config` file and your custom files**) and replace with files from one of the branches:
* Sitecore 8.1 Update-3 - [configuration/8.1.3](https://github.com/Sitecore/Sitecore-Configuration-Roles/tree/configuration/8.1.3)
* Sitecore 8.2 Initial Release - [configuration/8.2.0](https://github.com/Sitecore/Sitecore-Configuration-Roles/tree/configuration/8.2.0)
* Sitecore 8.2 Update-1 - [configuration/8.2.1](https://github.com/Sitecore/Sitecore-Configuration-Roles/tree/configuration/8.2.1)
* Sitecore 8.2 Update-2 - [configuration/8.2.2](https://github.com/Sitecore/Sitecore-Configuration-Roles/tree/configuration/8.2.2)
* Sitecore 8.2 Update-3 - [configuration/8.2.3](https://github.com/Sitecore/Sitecore-Configuration-Roles/tree/configuration/8.2.3)
* Sitecore 8.2 Update-4 - [configuration/8.2.4](https://github.com/Sitecore/Sitecore-Configuration-Roles/tree/configuration/8.2.4)
* Sitecore 8.2 Update-5 - [configuration/8.2.5](https://github.com/Sitecore/Sitecore-Configuration-Roles/tree/configuration/8.2.5)
* Sitecore 8.2 Update-6 - [configuration/8.2.6](https://github.com/Sitecore/Sitecore-Configuration-Roles/tree/configuration/8.2.6)
* Sitecore 8.2 Update-7 - [configuration/8.2.7](https://github.com/Sitecore/Sitecore-Configuration-Roles/tree/configuration/8.2.7)

Go through your custom configuration files and annotate configuration nodes that must be presented only in certain kind of instances. 

For example, the item saved event handlers in `Customization.config` file to be used only in the `ContentManagement` environment:

```xml
 <configuration xmlns:role="http://www.sitecore.net/xmlconfig/role/">
    <sitecore role:require="ContentManagement">
      <events>
        <event name="item:saved" role:require="ContentManagement">
          <handler type="Website.Class1, Website" method="OnItemSaved" />
```

### 3. Deploy

Deploy the files to both `ContentManagement` and `ContentDelivery` Sitecore instances:
```
App_Config/Include/**/*
bin/Sitecore.Configuration.Roles.dll
```

### 4. Update web.config files

Change `web.config` files of `ContentManagement` and `ContentDelivery` Sitecore instances so they are aware of their role. 

#### ContentManagement

```xml
  ...
  <configSections>
    <section name="sitecore" type="Sitecore.Configuration.Roles.RoleConfigReader, Sitecore.Configuration.Roles" />
    ...
  </configSections>
  <appSettings>
    ...
    <add key="role:define" value="ContentManagement" />
  </appSettings>
  ...
```

#### ContentDelivery

```xml
  ...
  <configSections>
    <section name="sitecore" type="Sitecore.Configuration.Roles.RoleConfigReader, Sitecore.Configuration.Roles" />
    ...
  </configSections>
  <appSettings>
    ...
    <add key="role:define" value="ContentDelivery" />
  </appSettings>
  ...
```

### 5. Verify if it works

(Optional) Verify actual configuration: 
* navigate to the `/sitecore/admin/showconfig.aspx` page of the `ContentDelivery` instance
* make sure that the definition of the `sitecore_master_index` index configuration element is not presented on the page

## Details

### 1.  Define Role Command

The `role:define` command defines pipe-separated list of configuration roles the given Sitecore instance has.    

The role name can be any string that matches the `[a-zA-Z0-9]+` pattern, however 
there are several commonly used **conventional role names** to use:

* Standalone
* ContentManagement
* Reporting
* Processing
* ContentDelivery

These roles are described below.       

#### Example

```xml
<configuration>
  ...
  <appSettings>
    ...
	   <add key="role:define" value="ContentManagement|Processing|CustomFeature1" />
  </appSettings>
  ...
</configuration>
```

### 2. Require Role Command

When `role:require` command is applied to a XML configuration node within Sitecore include config file
the node will be ignored if the boolean expression is false. When the expression is evaluated, every 
configuration role that is defined by the `role:define` command is being transformed into "true" and 
all undefined role naes are transformed into "false" condition.

### 3.  Modified configuration files

The module is shipped with modified stock configuration files to make Sitecore
pre-configured to serve each of these configuration roles. 

#### Standalone

Defines Standalone role that is the same as Sitecore pre-configured out of box. 
It allows only single-server set up.

#### ContentManagement 
  
Defines Content Management (CM) role that allows editors to use editing
applications like Content Editor, Page Editor etc.
  
#### Reporting
  
Defines xDB Reporting (Rep) role that fetches reporting data from various 
data sources to use in Sitecore reporting applications. It can be enabled
on the same instance with other roles or on a dedicated Sitecore instance.
  
#### Processing
  
Defines xDB Processing (Proc) role. It can be enabled on the same instance 
with other roles or on a dedicated Sitecore instance.
  
#### ContentDelivery
  
Defines Content Delivery (CD) role that assumes current Sitecore instance
is accessed only by end-users and Sitecore administrators. It cannot be 
enabled on the same instance with other roles. 

## Examples

EXAMPLE 1
Here is an example of Sitecore solution with single Sitecore instance.

- SRV-01: Standalone

EXAMPLE 2
Here is an example of Sitecore solution with 2 Sitecore instances: 
one is multipurpose, another is delivery only - both serve front-end users.

- SRV-01: ContentManagement|Processing|Reporting
- SRV-02: ContentDelivery

EXAMPLE 3
Here is an example of Sitecore solution with 5 Sitecore instances,
one content-management only, one processing and reporting and 3 delivery.

- SRV-01: ContentManagement
- SRV-02: Processing|Reporting
